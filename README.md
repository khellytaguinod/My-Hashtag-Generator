# My-Hashtag-Generator
Ex.3 bootstrap

# hashtag-generator
The code here is a starting point for a coding exercise in Bootstrap and CSS.

## The Excercise

- Fix the layout of the page to be responsive to mobile devices.
- Refactor the code to eliminate repeating code. Check out the [DRY principle](http://www.artima.com/intv/dry.html).
- After fixes and refactoring, add some of your own enhancements to the app.

## Sample App

The current HTML page is deployed at Netlify. See http://surgeon-doris-13214.netlify.com/.
